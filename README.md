## Intro <a name="intro"></a>
Dates on the ides, nones and kalends are given in the ablative.
Dates with ante are given in the accusative, so ante diem undecimum kalendas ianuarias. It's in the accusative because it expresses not the idea of being 'on' a certain day (like the ablative), but how long before the kalends it is.
This system uses inclusive counting, so ad xi kal ian is 22nd Dec.

Dates one day before a key date are given with pridie and the accusative, e.g. pridie kalendas ianuarias.

Heavily inspired by [Jonghakseo's vite chrome extension boilerplate](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite). 
It uses SASS instead of TailwindCSS if you want to check it out.
